# Brainstorming

## Prompt

"Brainstorm a list of potential use cases for a homelab focused on AI and automation. The homelab runs on a Proxmox cluster with a mix of VMs and LXC containers. The user is interested in exploring generative AI, infrastructure as code, and home automation.

Consider the following aspects:
- **Generative AI:** What are some interesting projects that could be built using open-source language models or image generation models?
- **Infrastructure as Code:** How can the user leverage tools like Terraform and Ansible to manage their homelab infrastructure?
- **Home Automation:** What are some practical ways to integrate the homelab with smart home devices (e.g., Home Assistant)?
- **Networking:** What are some advanced networking concepts that the user could experiment with (e.g., VLANs, VPNs, Pi-hole)?
- **Monitoring and Observability:** What tools and techniques can the user employ to monitor the health and performance of their homelab?

Please provide a diverse list of ideas, ranging from simple beginner-friendly projects to more advanced and complex ones."
