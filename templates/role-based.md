## Prompt

"Act as a seasoned DevOps engineer with expertise in building and maintaining homelab environments. The user, a software developer, wants to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized web application.

Your task is to provide a high-level overview of the steps involved, the tools you would recommend, and the best practices to follow.

Consider the following:
- **Source Control:** The user is using GitHub to host their code.
- **Containerization:** The application is containerized using Docker.
- **CI/CD Tool:** The user is open to using any open-source CI/CD tool that can be self-hosted in their homelab (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, Drone).
- **Deployment Target:** The application will be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster running in the homelab.

Please provide a clear and concise explanation that is easy for a developer to understand. Avoid overly technical jargon where possible, or explain it in simple terms."
