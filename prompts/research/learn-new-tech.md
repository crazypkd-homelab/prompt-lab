## Prompt

"I want to learn about Kubernetes. I have a basic understanding of Docker and containers, but I'm new to container orchestration.

Please create a learning plan for me to learn Kubernetes. The plan should be structured and include the following:
- **Prerequisites:** What are the prerequisites for learning Kubernetes?
- **Core Concepts:** What are the core concepts of Kubernetes that I should focus on (e.g., pods, services, deployments, etc.)?
- **Hands-on Projects:** What are some hands-on projects that I can do to practice my Kubernetes skills?
- **Resources:** What are some good resources for learning Kubernetes (e.g., tutorials, books, online courses)?

The learning plan should be suitable for a beginner and should provide a clear roadmap for learning Kubernetes from scratch."
