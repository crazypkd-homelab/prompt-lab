## Prompt

"Please improve the following prompt to get a better response from a language model.

**Original Prompt:** 'Write a script to automate my homelab.'

The improved prompt should be more specific and provide more context. It should include the following information:
- **What I want to automate.** What specific tasks do I want to automate?
- **My homelab setup.** What hardware and software am I using?
- **My skill level.** Am I a beginner or an experienced user?
- **The desired output.** What should the script do? What format should the output be in?

By providing a more detailed and specific prompt, I'm more likely to get a useful and relevant response from the language model."
