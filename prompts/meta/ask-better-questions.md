## Prompt

"I'm having a problem with my Proxmox server, but I'm not sure how to ask for help in a way that will get me a good answer.

My server keeps crashing, and I don't know why.

Please help me formulate a better question to ask on a forum or chat room. The question should include the following information:
- **A clear and concise description of the problem.** What is happening? What are the symptoms?
- **Relevant details about my setup.** What hardware am I using? What version of Proxmox am I running? What is my network configuration?
- **What I've tried so far.** What troubleshooting steps have I already taken?
- **Any relevant logs or error messages.**

By providing all of this information, I'm more likely to get a helpful response from the community."
