## Prompt

"I want to set up a CI/CD pipeline for my homelab. I'm looking for a solution that is:
- **Self-hosted:** I want to run the CI/CD server in my own homelab.
- **Open-source:** I prefer to use open-source tools.
- **Easy to use:** I'm new to CI/CD, so I'm looking for a solution that is easy to set up and configure.

I have a few projects on GitHub that I want to build, test, and deploy automatically. The projects are a mix of Python web applications and Ansible playbooks.

What are some good CI/CD solutions for my homelab? Please compare and contrast the following tools:
- Jenkins
- GitLab CI
- Drone
- Gitea Actions

For each tool, please discuss the following:
- **Ease of setup and configuration.**
- **Features and capabilities.**
- **Community and support.**
- **Integration with other tools (e.g., GitHub, Docker, Ansible).**

Please provide a recommendation based on my needs."
