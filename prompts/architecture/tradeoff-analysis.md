# Tradeoff Analysis Prompt

## Prompt

"I'm trying to decide between two different architectures for my homelab:

**Option 1: A single, powerful server**
- A single server with a high-end CPU, a lot of RAM, and a large amount of storage.
- All services would run on this single server, either in VMs or containers.

**Option 2: A cluster of smaller, less powerful servers**
- A cluster of three or four smaller servers (e.g., Raspberry Pis, Intel NUCs).
- Services would be distributed across the cluster using a container orchestrator like Kubernetes.

Please provide a tradeoff analysis of these two options. Consider the following factors:
- **Cost:** Which option is more cost-effective?
- **Performance:** Which option offers better performance?
- **Reliability and Availability:** Which option is more reliable and offers better availability?
- **Scalability:** Which option is easier to scale in the future?
- **Power Consumption:** Which option is more power-efficient?
- **Complexity:** Which option is more complex to set up and manage?

Please provide a recommendation based on my needs. I'm a software developer who wants to learn more about distributed systems and container orchestration."
