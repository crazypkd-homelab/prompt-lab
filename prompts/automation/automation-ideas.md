## Prompt

"I'm looking for automation ideas for my homelab. I have a Proxmox server with a few VMs and containers running various services, including Home Assistant, a Plex media server, and a Pi-hole.

I'm interested in automating the following:
- **Backups:** How can I automate the process of backing up my VMs and containers to a remote location (e.g., a NAS or cloud storage)?
- **Updates:** How can I automate the process of updating the operating system and applications on my servers?
- **Monitoring:** How can I set up automated alerts to notify me of any issues with my homelab (e.g., a service is down, a disk is full)?
- **Self-healing:** Are there any self-healing mechanisms I can implement to automatically restart failed services or containers?

Please provide me with some specific automation ideas and the tools I would need to implement them."
