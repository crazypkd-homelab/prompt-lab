# Cron vs. Event-Driven Automation Prompt

## Prompt

"Explain the difference between cron-based automation and event-driven automation in the context of a homelab.

Provide examples of when you would use each type of automation.

For example:
- **Cron-based:**
  - Running a backup script every night at 2am.
  - Checking for system updates every Sunday morning.
- **Event-driven:**
  - Automatically restarting a container when it crashes.
  - Turning on a light when a motion sensor is triggered in Home Assistant.

Discuss the pros and cons of each approach and recommend which one to use for different scenarios."
