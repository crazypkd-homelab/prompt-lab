## Example Deprecated Prompt

### Prompt to generate a Jenkins pipeline

**Reason for deprecation:** We have migrated to GitLab CI and no longer use Jenkins.

**Original Prompt:**
"Generate a Jenkins pipeline script (Jenkinsfile) for a simple Java web application. The pipeline should have the following stages:
- Build: Compile the Java code using Maven.
- Test: Run unit tests using JUnit.
- Deploy: Deploy the application to a Tomcat server.
"
